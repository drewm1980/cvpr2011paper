Intel Xeon X5550 2.66 GHz
24 GB RAM (i think so)
nVidia Tesla C1060

GPU: (mescal607.cs.berkeley.edu)
Intel Core i7 920 2.66 GHz
8 GB RAM
lspci gives nVidia GTX 285..... I thought this was a fermi machine.... I wonder if it was switched...

   if the GPU on mescal is NOT a fermi, you may want to re-run the experiments on your machine.
   data: cvpr2011/matlab/bench_PALM1_batch.m  (change type to either "GPU" or "BLAS")

   be sure its bench_PALM_paper1.m, with a ONE!
