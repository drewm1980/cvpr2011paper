Comments about IJCB from Chapter 4 onward: 

1. Remove the sentence between 311-314. We are only concerned about single GPU performance in this paper. The sentence is not our concern in this paper. 
DONE

2. Line 374: sse should be SSE. 
DONE

3. Remove footnote 3: Not our concern to predict whether the vector units will double. It has no consequences to our experiments. 
DONE

4. Figure 2: remove smily face. remove pseudo-inverse of A_i. 
DONE

To save space, we could rotate A as A transpose and draw a fat matrix in subfigure 1. Move 16 KB block and A_i in one row above A of 3.1 MB. 
DONE

Why written KiB and MiB? They should be simply KB and MB, consistent with the rest of the paper. 
KiB and MiB are the technically more correct way to specify the values that are powers of two.  The paper should be consistent now.
DONE

5. Overall, I think "on-chip cache" is redundant. We should define cache as on-chip memory the first time referred in the paper, and subsequently simply use "cache". 
DONE

6. The term "warp" was not well defined. The first use of it is in footnote 5 without definition. The it was used in line 422 to denote "warp-level concurrency".  
Its definition needs to be given in the main text first. 

While writing that section I spent hours trying to come up with an explanation of the CUDA pragramming model
that was concise enough for the paper yet still accurate, but I don't think it is possible; this is noted in the paper.
The footnotes are for readers who are already familiar with CUDA terminology.  I changed "warp-level" to "thread-level"
to keep cuda programming model terms out of the body of the paper.  
DONE

7. remove "obtain <to>" in line 447. 
DONE

replace line 450 by: sought iteratively by linearization at each $j$th step as follows: 
DONE

8. Line 469. Change "the computation time …" to "the overall computational complexity is still dominated by the inner loop ALM iterations." 
Computational complexity is a theoretical CS term that isn't appropriate here; this statement is empirical.  
I changed the sentence to read a bit better.
DONE

9. line 529: change "see" to "SSE". Please do a global replacement of the typo. 
DONE

11. Line 583. Change "intel" to "Intel". 
DONE

12. Line 585. Which matrix is to be inverted with n\times n dimension? 
DONE

Did we already mention that matrix inverse does not dominate the alignment ALM previously? Should as well remove that. 
I deleted the first instance of this, which was just the last remaining shred of what used to be a discussion of comutational complexity.
DONE

Line 587 to the end of Section 4.2 may be too detailed. Could as well remove that. 
Float vs. double precision is a very significant aspect of the implementation since they affect both accuracy and runtime,
so I can't delete it entirely.  I did, however, remove the speculation on how blas libraries might/should be implemented internally.
DONE

Also, paragraph 617-619 can go. Trivial to assume experiment will be in Section 6. 
Further, not precise to mention synthetic image data. We did not do simulation on alignment. 
DONE

13. For consistency, please replace $\ell_1$-minimization or $\ell_1$
minimization as $\ell_1$-min globally except the first time in Introduction. 
DONE

14. Replace the sentence from line 624 "to represent the aligned testing image …" by "to recover a sparse representation for classification:"  
Need to give away explicitly each A_i is independently rectified by \tau_i^{-1}, as eqn (2) does not illustrate the whole idea. 
DONE

15. Last sentence in Line 629 is redundant. Literature review has been done in
Introduction. No need to cite previous works again in the technical part. 
DONE

16. typo ell_1 in Line 631. Also last sentence of line 635 is not necessary. Trivial to assume Section 6 contains experiments to justify our discussion. 
DONE

We can merge the above two paragraphs as one paragraph. 
DONE

18. Line 690. add "on <the> CPU and GPU platforms".  
DONE

There are missing references in the latex. Please fix those. 
DONE

Could we use different markers other than + and x, because the two are rotational symmetric. Say, + and circle. 
DONE

19. Please do not use past tense in the paper describe what we do. Use present tense. Example, change "benchmarked" to "benchmark" 
DONE, at least for the experiments section.

20. The table in Line 766 doesn't have caption. Either we describe those numbers as part of the paragraph, or we use a formal table with everything. 
DONE, converted to table.  I actually had both versions in the .tex source; wasn't sure which was better.

21. Line 772. Lack transition between the two paragraphs. What is the connection between the discussion about CMU and the above. 
DONE

22. Line 793. It reads cumbersome: "it takes fort our proposed CPU and GPU algorithms…" Change to: 
Figure 5 shows the average run time of the CPU and GPU implementations to align
a query image against all the subject classes separately. We vary the number of
subject classes to show how the algorithms scale. 
DONE

24. Line 860: typo: "Since would expect" 
DONE

The legend is out of bound.
DONE
---------------------------------------------
17. Line 683. Algorithm 3 does not require pseudoinverse of A. Am I missing something here? 
TODO: Figure out if code is calling the correct solver.

10. Is the conclusion in Section 4.1, that solving a single alignment problem by the entire CPU and MKL, justified anywhere in the experiment? 
Currently this is only justified by being faster than our earlier paper.  I want to run a benchmark for this.
TODO

Figure 5 shows the comparison between CPU and GPU. But we need one extra comparison (possibly superimposed on the same setting in Figure 5) between problem-parallelism and pixel-level parallelism. 
See previous.
TODO

For all CPU/GPU comparison, please modify the plots to use the same marker style, line style, and color style to be consistent. 
DONE for Victor's plots
TODO for Drew's plot

Figure 5 also needs to be redrawn to use the same Matlab styles as the rest. 
TODO

23. I suggest we remove Figure 6 and the corresponding description. It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss thresholding the alignment error. It is a problem in the original face recognition problem, but has nothing to do with parallelization. 
TODO: Replace this figure with timing for recognition stage.

25. Please redraw Figure 7. Also need to enforce the same convention for the x,y-axis units. For example, y-axis label in here should be "Accuracy [%]" 
TODO
